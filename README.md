This project focuses on integrating and visualizing datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). It involves merging at least five datasets into a single data frame using Python and Pandas, followed by the creation of interactive visualizations with the Bokeh library. The visualizations explore health trends, including age and gender differences in weight, body mass index (BMI), and cholesterol levels. Key findings reveal significant insights into dietary intake correlations and health metrics. The project also emphasizes ethical considerations in handling sensitive health data, ensuring participant privacy while drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis
